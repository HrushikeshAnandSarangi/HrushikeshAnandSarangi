## About

I like understanding how things work at the lowest level possible — and then pushing them a bit further.

Most of my time goes into systems-level work, performance-sensitive code, and tooling where correctness actually matters. I enjoy working close to the metal, reasoning about memory, concurrency, and failure modes, and turning vague ideas into something that survives real-world use.

I am especially interested in Rust, not as a trend, but as a tool for building reliable, long-lived systems.

## Philosophy

If something sparks my curiosity, I will take it apart — whether it is a compiler pass, a distributed system, a protocol, or something that probably should not be touched unless you really want to understand it.

I do not chase stacks. I chase problems.
