## About

I care about understanding systems from the inside out.

Most of my work revolves around performance-sensitive code, low-level abstractions, and tooling where correctness, failure modes, and long-term maintainability matter more than trends.

I am particularly interested in Rust as a practical language for building reliable systems, but the problems themselves come first — languages are just tools.

## Philosophy

If something captures my interest, I will take it apart until I understand it.

That might be a compiler component, a distributed system, a protocol, or an idea that fails a few times before it works.

I do not chase stacks.  
I chase problems.
